# KTMM: Kernel Tiered Memory Module #
The KTMM Project is a module for the Linux kernel designed to enhance the current Clock
algorithm for page replacement. The implementation is an alternate approach to a dynamic
tiering system for memory intensive applications aimed at modern server platforms. Most 
of the work in the repo is based on the Multi-Clock research and prototype for kernel 
verions 5.3.
